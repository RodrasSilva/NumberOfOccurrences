## Number Of Occurrences 


Project developed in the Concurrent Programming Course in ISEL

Developed this project with [Rui](https://github.com/RuiPacas) during my course.


C# Application for searching the number of occurences of a given string using TPL(Task Parallel Library) and C# asynchronous methods (async).

Provided the `path` to a folder and a specific word, presents for each file inside the given folder and sub-folders the lines that contain the specific word.

In the end the user is presented with the total number of files processed, the total number of files which contain at least one line with the given word and the total number of lines with the string.
